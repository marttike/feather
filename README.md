Light weight php survey system.

Still very much in alpha, but you can test this by downloading everything to folder on your server.

questionnaire.json has examples of all existing question types and how questions can be divided on pages.
index.php contains all code required
logo.png is used on the background

answers are saved to /asnwers as .json files

If you want people to be able to change their answers later on, use an user id on the url e.g. .../
index.php?u=123
